# Type Script cource app 

Try to create a similar table (ignore top/left bars/tripple dot popover)
Add all the components (avatar, texts, labels)
Implement functionality to add users to/remove users from the list (pretty sure you'll manage, but don't hesitate to ask me where to find some random images API). Use local storage with serialised JSON's to store the state for now
Stick to the colors more or less, but ignore the actual sizes of the components for simplicity
Don't use any UI libraries/components (for now)
